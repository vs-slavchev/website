                    <p>In the time of high attention to AI and data science we talk about the high value of data and how large amounts of it are precious. 
                      Governments try to regulate how it is collected, shared and protected. But do you know who are the fathers of information science?</p>
                    <p>I stumbled upon this wikipedia article of a Belgian who lived in the 19th-20th century and the article had only 1400 visitors over the 
                      last 30 days. I thought it was a pity that I had never heard of that man. His name was Paul Otlet and he wanted access to knowledge for 
                      people. His friend and colleague Henry La Fontaine was the first president of the International Peace Bureau - the world’s oldest 
                      international peace organisation, with 10 of its members having received a Nobel Peace prize - his article even less visited.</p>
                    <p>In short Otlet got fascinated by sharing information and setup a service where cards containing text were carefully curated and 
                      systematically queried. The amount of requests quickly grew in a matter of years. This is why I mentioned wikipedia earlier, it was 
                      the same - just in 1896, and much slower. It was meant to be easier to use it for searching and had a concept similar to hyperlinks.</p>
                    <p>The government of Belgium gave him buildings and budget to expand his efforts. But then the Great war started, where one of his sons 
                      lost his life. Otlet believed that forming an international organisation that promotes knowledge sharing can prevent future wars and 
                      he defined a charter of human rights.</p>
                    <p>I felt strange that the information about this man is not more well known. And it makes me think not about the man, but about the 
                      relationship we as a civilisation have with information. Its value over the centuries and our desire to ask for it and use it.</p>
                    <p>Another thing I found interesting is that he was not stuck in his ways and beliefs. When new tech like radio and microfilm came 
                      up he started incorporating it in his efforts. I can imagine how someone else would have seen these new changes as a threat.</p>
                    <p>He did also have dreams of building a utopian city that would be the center of the knowledge of the world, but despite never 
                      being even started he still worked on what he believed.</p>
                    <p>I will leave the rest of the researching to you, I just wanted to spark an interest.</p>

                    <p>Because we don't have enough inputs on the arduion we can implement a key matrix to 
                      detect which keys are pressed. This way the needed input are the number of columns plus rows.</p>
                    <p>The way it works is that we send a signal on one row and check which columns receive it. Then check the next row the same way.</p>
                    <p>The basic idea of the matrix scanning:
                    <img src="img/keyboard_1_scanning.png" class="w3-round-large w3-mobile w3-image"></p>
                    <p>There is the problem called ghosting - keys which are not really pressed register as being pressed.
                        Using diodes we can prevent the effect.</p>
                    <p> Here is how it happens when diodes are not present:
                    <img src="img/keyboard_2_scanning.png" class="w3-round-large w3-mobile w3-image"></p>
                    <p>As you can see the right column does receive a signal when it is the top row's turn to send it, because the signal goes 
                      through the top-left pressed key to the left column and then to the bottom column through the bottom-left key and then to the 
                      bottom row through the bottom-right key. That means that the top right switch is registered as pressed, but it's not.</p>
                    <p>And here is the same scenario, but with diodes:
                    <img src="img/keyboard_3_scanning.png" class="w3-round-large w3-mobile w3-image"></p>
                    <p>It is a good idea to test by soldering using very little tin - just enough to hold on, instead of trying to fiddle with 
                      holding them in place.</p>
                    <p>I decided to switch the wiring from the blogs I read - my rows are connected directly and columns use diodes</p>
                    <p>You can use this jewelry making pliers to make little loops that can go onto the switch legs or the wires.</p>
                    <img src="img/keyboard_diode_loops.jpg" class="w3-round-large w3-mobile w3-image">
                    <p>The next problem to solve is debouncing - detecting that a key is pressed and realeased many times in a short time, 
                      while in fact the key is only being pressed or released, but the contact between the metal plates in the switch is not 
                      really solid while in the process of moving. After doing the research I found there are hardware and software ways to solve 
                      this problem. The hardware one is with capacitors, but that makes it more of a hassle for me. There are multiple ways to solve 
                      it with software:
                      <ul>
                        <li>waiting for a certain amount of time over which no change happens - this way we can be sure that the state is stable and 
                          we can read this as the current situation - this is slower, but might not be noticable</li>
                        <li>detecting the first change and registering that one, then ignoring changes for some time and checking the state after this 
                          time - this is per key and is making the decision faster than the previous one</li>
                        <li>only checking for changes every 50 milliseconds, for example - this is fast and easy to do, but is on all keys</li>
                        <li>track the state over time and accumulate the values to calculate to which extreme it is more close - this is not 
                          fast and might not be very robust without tuning</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>My first approach is to do it the simple way and put more effort when those results become unsatisfactory for my needs. 
                      So I will only check the state of all keys every 25 milliseconds.</p>
                    <p>The next thing to do is make a layout for our keys. I decided to have preprocessor macros that map a readable name to a 
                      keycode of type byte. I can send these bytes to the receiving host without mapping them. The key names I can use to initialize 
                      a 2D array which will represent how I want my keys to be ordered. When I know the position of a pressed key in terms of row 
                      and column I can then access the resulting keycode through the array.</p>
                    <img src="img/keyboard_code.png" class="w3-round-large w3-mobile w3-image">
                    <p>Later on this could become a 3D array when we need to have multiple layouts.</p>

                    <p>A colleague of mine has a fancy keyboard - the OKLB Planck. It is sold as a DIY kit that you assemble and program yourself. 
                      I was unsure how I feel about it when I first saw it. But his explanations quickly got me fascinated and I decided to make my 
                      own - even more DIY style. I would 3D print everything and make some improvements like bluetooth. Another problem he had with 
                      his was the lack of a way to indicate on which layout level you are. And maybe a gesture sensor to swipe with. And maybe a gyroscope 
                      to use it like a mouse or driving wheel.</p>
                    <p>First I decided to go simple and just make a keyboard without bluetooth or anything fancy. Then learn from the mistakes and improve 
                      to make a second one that is closer to the real goal.</p>
                    <p>I ordered cheap switches and a pcb to make the process easier. At this point I thought that a big step of this project will be coming 
                      up with a good layout for my needs. Also because I take key bindings too seriously.</p>
                    <p>I found 3D models from the original designer and decided to print them. I also found a model of a keycap and modified it to make it 
                      printable without much support and add a bump for the index fingers. The keycaps turned out not fitting the switches, so I had to 
                      rework them a few more times.</p>
                    <p>The 3D models can be found <a href="https://github.com/vs-slavchev/keyboard">here on my github</a>.</p>
                    <p>The pcb was not fitting the models I found and was not very happy with them anyway, and they were not designed to be 3D printed 
                      to start with. I started planning how could I make a case that does not use bolts and nuts.</p>
                    <p>I printed a few simple clips see if I could use those. Some of them I printed impoperly, some were very stiff and I struggled 
                      to design better ones. I realised something very important then: instead of going for a perfect solution I should have gone for 
                      a satisfactory one and improve when needed.</p>
                    <p>I immediately made a few simple holes in a new top half model and found some M3 and M2 12mm bolts. After that I started designing 
                      a new bottom case, but adjusting it's height would have to wait.</p>
                    <p>Another problem was that I damaged or bricked the PCB so I also had to start again with that. The big problem was that I had 
                      soldered the switches onto the PCB, so I had to unsolder them one by one. It cost me 4 hours and a few burns to do that. But I 
                      did learn to do less ambitious planning upfront. I will never forget this lesson because fixing broken switches is one of the 
                      most tedious and fiddly things I’ve ever done.</p>
                    <p>The next step was to figure out how to use an Arduino for the keyboard. I could flash it with the QMK firmware. Or write some code myself.</p>
                    <p>When you want to detect button presses on 48 keys while having less than 48 pins is not straight forward. So I found a few excellent blogs 
                      on how matrix scanning works:
                      <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/">http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/">http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/</a></li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>After understanding the hardware I did some searching. First I found the matrix scanning code 
                      <a href="https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad/blob/master/src/Keypad.cpp">in a file</a> from the Keypad library for Arduino. Then I found 
                      a <a href="https://github.com/di0ib/StenoFW/blob/master/StenoFW.ino">file</a> from a stenography keyboard open source project, which 
                      also did a similar job. It was very helpful to learn from this available code.</p>
                    <p>Making a keyboard without a pcb is called handwiring and I found a nice post about it: 
                      <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87689.0">https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87689.0</a>.</p>
                    <p>With the plan changed, and my student budget limits, I actually had more fun finding my way through.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to make a murder mystery for my DnD group. When the moment came and I started preparing for the session I found there is a lot of 
                      advice, but not a lot of easy inspiration. There are a few prepared adventures, and those are not very polished or detailed. I used some of 
                      them for inspiration and a base and stole some ideas from them. Maybe you can take mine and improve it to have fun with your players.</p>
                    <p>I had planned his for along time as I expected that one of my players would not attend at some point. Perfect opportunity to throw the 
                      characters into a pocket dimension for a one shot without advancing the main story. I gave one of them this book with empty pages and a 
                      whirlpool on the cover.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to have prepared statblocks for all the stuff they can encounter.</p>
                    <p>I was greatly inspired by the adventure called 
                      <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/181052/How-Not-to-Host-a-Murder-5e">"How not to host a murder mystery"</a></p>
                    <p>I have left out the names as I think it's easier to navigate the story since we are looking at it's structure and not for entertainment.</p>
                    <p>Everything starts in a whirlpool in the sea, hence the cover of the book. The characters are on a small ship with <victim> heading to the 
                      city on the coast. During the whirlpool another group of adventurers (goblins?), who read another book of the same type, are summoned on 
                      the ship. <victim>, <innocent> and his colleagues are on the ship, and the characters are offered to to stay in the <victim>'s mansion. 
                        They were all summoned because he found this book and wanted to figure it out so cast some spells and activated all the books. <victim> 
                          introduces <innocent> as his brave but foolish, quick to act apprentice.</p>
                    <p>The mansion, <victim> explains was built thanks to his father’s successful business of trading rapiers, short swords and daggers. His 
                      father died 6 years ago.</p>
                    <p>Garden:<br>
                        Morning glory - a flower that blooms in the morning because of sunlight and it’s petals are closed when in shadow or darkness; a 
                        letter is hidden under the open petals in the day, but when darkness makes them close it is easy to spot. The letter is written 
                        with the same handwriting as the book of the <killer>, it is to the girl of the apprentice saying that he will not give up on their 
                          love. This can be used to have the <killer> try to frame <innocent>.</p>
                    <p>Time before dinner: the players are invited to do something before it is time for dinner: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>With <killer> and <innocent> to practice spells [openly said] (so all 3 including the PC seem suspicious); <killer> doesn’t want 
                        to waste mana; The <innocent> calls <killer> by his middle-name. The other players will not know whom this name belongs when they see it.</li>
                      <li>With sister to show you around: offers a reward a knife from the father’s collection of rare craftsman knives [openly said] (so the 
                        sister and the PC sound suspicious) In private they find that one specific knife is missing from its stand - Lord Kelnor’s pearl dagger</li>
                      <li>With cook to help prepare the big dinner. [openly said]; In private he tells the motive of both <innocent> and <sister>. He is grumpy 
                        and very skilled with cutting meat with his knife; he says the sister has a necklace with a gem that allows her to seduce and control weak men</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The players are given the information separately through notes and they should get a bit confused and suspect each other.</p>
                    <p>Dining room:<br>
                        During dinner the characters can talk to <innocent>, <killer>, <victim>’s sister who is a paid assassin, the cook, the old nanny</p>
                    <p><killer> says he will go and help the cook to set up the table. <innocent> says that he will go and find the host <victim> because 
                      he should have been here already. He leaves the room and in a bit everyone hears him scream.</p>
                    <p><victim> is stabbed in the heart in his study. There is no weapon there. Actually the knife <killer> used was conjured by Spiritual weapon.</p>
                    <p><killer> points the finger at innocent and explains his motive. <innocent> explains that he had the choice to give up on his study, but 
                      made up his mind and was no longer interested in marrying the girl. <innocent> has a fresh letter to her stating that he will find a way to 
                      be with her and won’t give up on their love.</p>
                    <p>The real killer has to be found before sunrise otherwise the framed <innocent> will be hanged.</p>
                    <p><innocent> is a young novice, brave but foolish, quick to act. <victim> doesn’t let <innocent> marry the daughter of a blacksmith because 
                      she will distract him from his studies.</p>
                    <p>Cook - not speaking a lot / low voice / bitter</p>
                    <p>The study:<br>
                        Has a book with spells (belongs to:<killer>’s name on the inside cover), every page has notes in the margins. Some of the notes are 
                        crossed out and with another color and handwriting more notes are taken. The second notes match the handwriting on the papers on <victim>’s 
                        desk. On the spell Spiritual weapon there are a lot of scribbles and in all caps: HAVE TO ASK <killer’s middle name> HOW TO CAST THIS!</p>
                    <p>Trophies on a shelf saying: First place in spellcasting/conjuring/arcana competition - <victim></p>
                    <p>Building the structure of the mystery:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><innocent> has motive and opportunity(to go bring victim), but no means</li>
                          <li><killer> has motive(fame,praise), means(stabbing), opportunity(the fact that the apprentice and the sister now have a motive)</li>
                          <li>Cook has means(knife with blood), no motive and no opportunity</li>
                          <li>Sister has motive(she is younger and can inherit the mansion that she likes very much if her brother dies), but no means and no 
                            opportunity, but definitely suspicious being an assassin</li>
                          <li>Old nanny - no motive, no means, no opportunity</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Hello! Read on if you decided to switch to IntelliJ, set it up, make it comfortable and learn how to be more productive with it. 
                      This post covers some settings and custom shortcuts.</p>
                    <p>The first things that annoyed me were the popups in the top-right corner. To disable some of them:
                      'Event log' on the bottom-right (or Speech bubble icon) -> Settings. Disabling the balloons doesn't hide the
                      notifications from the event log, so you can check that if you need to.</p>
                    <p>Next up is removing the default comment generated at the top of a new class file.<br>
                      File -> Settings -> Editor -> File and Code Templates -> 'Includes' tab -> File header -> the comment is on the right
                      -> delete it.
                      If you would like to use this feature make sure to print the date in a less ambiguous format.</p>
                    <p>Another one is the vertical line in the editor that is set to 120 chars per line by default. To change the line
                      limit:
                      <br>File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Right margin columns.<br>
                      <i>The <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide</a> recommends a column limit of 100 chars.</i></p>
                    <p>Ok hotkeys. Some are very hard to reach, hard to learn or conflict with something else. Here are some recommendations
                      how to make your life easier. You don't need to remove the old shortcut, so if someone else wants to use your Idea they
                      can still use the default keys they know. Go to <br>File -> Settings -> Keymap<br> and find the ones you need to change, then click on
                      them and select 'Add keyboard shortcut'. All of the recommended ones are unused and should be added as alternatives. For each
                      entry I have specified: the name of the command, the default shortcut, the suggested one and an explanation.</p>
                    <p><b>Rename:</b> default - Shift F6, suggested - Alt R. This default key is famous for being so hard to reach. Usage of
                      rename should be encouraged as naming things is one of the hardest tasks in programming. Remember it as R stands for rename.</p>
                    <p><b>Find usage:</b> default - Alt F7, suggested - rightAlt U. Shows you where a method/variable is used. One hand -
                      easy. Associate U with usage.</p>
                    <p><b>Surround with...:</b> default - Ctrl Alt T, suggested - Alt T. Surrounds the selected code with
                      if/elseif/while/for/try... etc. Some Linux distros have the terminal shortcut bound to Ctrl Alt T so that causes a conflict. Even if you don't 
                      care about that the alternative is still 1 less key to press.</p>
                    <p><b>Delete line at caret:</b> default - Ctrl Y, suggested - Alt X. In Eclipse it was easy to Ctrl D with one hand, but
                      Ctrl Y requires both hands. The Alt and X keys are next to each other and this one is very easy to press. The X can be associated with
                      double-crossing something.</p>
                    <p><b>Run:</b> default - Alt Shift F10, suggested - Alt P. Usefulness depends on how often you run the project. P as in
                      play for the green arrow icon. An even easier variant is Alt E as in execute.</p>
                    <p>Next, I have compiled a list of the more notable shortcuts. Some are based on people's opinion from Stackoverflow. A more complete list 
                      can be found <a href="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf">here</a>
                      and <a href="https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/win/IntelliJ.html">here</a>
                      and you can always check the key for actions by pressing Ctrl Alt A in Idea.</p>

                    <p>Until the 1960s scientists could not explain how termites manage to organise their activity to gather and pile up
                      in one place all the wood pieces they find. Different theories tried to explain this like unaudible languages, but
                      the truth was that they just followed simple rules, from which emerged a complex behaviour.</p>
                    <p>By taking a piece of wood when they encounter it and dropping it when they encounter another one the termites
                      move the pieces to one or more piles, which in turn also get combined into bigger piles. The result is cleared
                      areas and compact piles.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to make a fantasy game with a lot of freedom and especially less popular features or activities to do. Things like gambling,
                    playing minigames, praying to different deities, eating and drinking, ordering said food and beverages, talking with npcs without the
                    purpose of getting something for it. This combined with the lack of epicness of the setting made it feel more ordinary and calm.
